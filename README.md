# Bedside Chats
Bedside Chats is an Android application intended to ease communication between patients and doctors at the bedside through the use of slide deck cards containing questions that patients might have.

Bedside Chats allows users to select a language of their choice, select a deck of questions from a variety of categories, and then sift through that selected deck to write notes and choose questions that they would like to ask their healthcare provider.

Bedside Chats also allows users to utilize the main card deck functionality without ever creating an account, however user accounts are also supported and allow users to view previous deck and question selections when subsequently using the application.
